## What You'll Find:

#### PhD Projects
Research-focused projects that leverage data science techniques in the context of astrophysics. These projects highlight advanced methods in:

- **Getting spectra from MaNGA galaxies**
- **Using Machine Learning to predict galaxy gradients**
- **Correcting double peaks in emission lines of stacked spectra**

#### Real-World Projects
Independent projects designed to explore various domains of data science. These include:

- **Data visualizations using tools like Plotly and Dash**
- **Solving practical problems in areas such as climate science, finance, and more**



## Global Temperature Data Dashboard

### Project Overview
This project provides an interactive dashboard to visualize global temperature changes over time using data from the Global Land Temperatures dataset. The dashboard allows users to explore average yearly temperatures by country and observe changes in temperature over the years.
This project includes:

- A choropleth map displaying average yearly temperatures by country.
- A choropleth map visualizing the change in average temperature over time.
- A line chart that shows the historical temperature trends for individual countries.

Built using **Dash** and **Plotly**, this dashboard helps visualize climate data interactively, making it easier to track changes over time and across regions.

### Project Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to create a visually appealing and informative dashboard that allows users to analyze temperature trends across different countries. It aims to highlight the impact of climate change by showcasing average temperature changes from the first recorded year to the most recent year.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Dash
- Plotly
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook (for development)
- HTML/CSS (for basic styling)

### Dataset
The project uses the Global Land Temperatures by Country dataset, which contains historical temperature data collected from various countries.

### Features
- **Interactive Dropdown**: Users can select a country to visualize its average temperature trends over the years.
- **Choropleth Maps**:
  - A map displaying the average yearly temperature for each country.
  - A map showing the change in average yearly temperature from the first to the last recorded year, with hover information that includes:
    - First and last year of data
    - Average temperatures for those years
- **Line Chart**: A line chart visualizing the temperature trend for the selected country.

### Future Improvements
Incorporate additional data sources for more comprehensive analysis (e.g., CO2 emissions).
Add more interactive features, such as filtering by year range.
Enhance the design and usability of the dashboard.
Include options to download the displayed data or graphs.
